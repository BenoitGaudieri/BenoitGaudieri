## Full-Stack Software Engineer | AI Enthusiast

I've been building web and mobile applications for 5+ years, with a strong focus on integrating AI into real-world products. I started experimenting with LLMs back when GPT-3 was just emerging, and I've been hooked ever since.

**Backend:** Node.js, Python, Laravel, PHP  
**AI/ML:** LangChain, LlamaIndex, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, RAG pipelines, MCP, Stable Diffusion, Vector DBs
**Data:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Vector DBs (Supabase)

### 🚀 What I'm Working On
- Building local-first RAG pipelines with LangChain and Ollama
- Exploring generative AI for both text and images
- Creating seamless full-stack experiences from database to UI

### 🎯 Philosophy
I believe in learning by doing. Whether it's a new framework, an emerging AI model, or a challenging architectural problem—I dive in and build something real.
